# PDGHome
A weird little homepage I made.

![PDG Home](http://i.imgur.com/qEUnk6j.jpg)

## Installation
I dunno. Host it on a secure server somewhere or somewhere local. I'm bad at coding.

## Using…
[DarkSky](https://darksky.net/dev/) for weather

Google's geo-location thing for Location

Unspash Source for the background image

[Weather Icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/) for the weather icons

Google Fonts for the fonts

FontAwesome for the icons

JQuery for making it work

## To Do List
Maybe make it work on more than my MacBook Pro? 

## Since I made this for myself…
It's probably going to suck. Sorry!
