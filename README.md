# PDGHome
A weird little homepage I made.

## Installation
I dunno. Host it on a secure server somewhere or somewhere local. I'm bad at coding.

## Using…
DarkSky's API for weather
Google's geo-location thing for Location
Unspash Source for the background image
Weather Icons for the weather icons
Google Fonts for the fonts
FontAwesome for the icons
JQuery for making it work

## To Do List
Maybe make it work on more than my MacBook Pro? 

## Since I made this for myself…
It's probably going to suck. Sorry!
